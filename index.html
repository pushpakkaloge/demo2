    <h1>SuperNova</h1>
    <p>A supernova (pl: supernovae or supernovas) is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star.
         A supernova occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white
          dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the progeni
          tor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed to 
          form a diffuse nebula. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to 
          that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.

        The last supernova directly observed in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, 
        appearing not long after Tycho's Supernova in 1572, both of which were visible to the 
        naked eye. The remnants of more recent supernovae have been found, and observations of 
        supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on average about three 
        times every century. A supernova in the Milky Way would almost certainly be observable
         through modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN
          1987A, which was the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic
           Cloud, a satellite of the Milky Way.
