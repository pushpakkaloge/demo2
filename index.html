        Higgs Boson
    </h1>
    <p>   
      The Higgs boson, sometimes called the Higgs particle,[9][10] is an elementary particle in the
      Standard Model of particle physics produced by the quantum excitation of the Higgs field,
      [11][12] one of the fields in particle physics theory.[12] In the Standard Model, the Higgs
      particle is a massive scalar boson with zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric 
      charge, and no colour charge that couples to (interacts with) mass.[13] It is also very 
      unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately upon generation.

      The Higgs field is a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components 
      that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. Its "Mexican hat-shaped" 
      potential leads it to take a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), 
      which breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction and, via the Higgs 
      mechanism, gives mass to many particles.
    
      Both the field and the boson are named after physicist Peter Higgs, who in 1964, along with 
      five other scientists in three teams, proposed the Higgs mechanism, a way for some particles
      to acquire mass. (All fundamental particles known at the time[c] should be massless at very
      high energies, but fully explaining how some particles gain mass at lower energies had 
      been extremely difficult.) If these ideas were correct, a particle known as a scalar 
      boson should also exist (with certain properties). This particle was called the Higgs 
      boson and could be used to test whether the Higgs field was the correct explanation.
